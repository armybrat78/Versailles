			<h2>A Brief History</h2>
			<blockquote cite="http://www.aviewoncities.com/paris/versailles.htm"> <p> The town of Versailles sits about twenty kilometers outside of Paris. The first mention of the town and estate was in 1038, when the name appeared in a charter of the Abbey of Saint-Père de Chartres. By the end of the Palace of Versailles eleventh century, Versailles was a country village enveloping a castle and the church of Saint-Julien, remaining prosperous until well into the thirteenth century. After the Hundred Years War, however, only a handful of people lived there.<br><br>
			In the sixteenth century, the Gondi family became the rulers of Versailles and the town began to gain acclaim when future King Louis XIII visited and became enamored with the site. He purchased land in the area and proceeded to build a small brick and stone lodge there in 1622. Ten years later, he became the lord of Versailles and began enlarging his lodge. Soon, he purchased more land as well as Gondi's estate. Louis XIII dies in 1643.<br><br>
			In 1662, the new king - Louis XIV - took an earnest interest in Versailles. Louis XIV, also known as The Sun King, distrusted the Parisians and wanted to move his Royal Residence away from the Louvre Palace, which was at the heart of constant political turbulence. The Sun King was largely responsible for the expansion that resulted in the building that still stands today. He hired architect Louis Le Vau along with artist Charles Le Brun to carry out the work on this Baroque masterpiece, which became the quintessential model for all palaces in Europe. Famed gardener André le Nôtre was responsible for the unequalled Versailles Garden. After Le Vau's death, Jules Hardouin- Mansart was commissioned to triple the size of the palace. Under his watchful eye, the northern and southern wings, the Orangerie, the Grand Trianon (a chateau) and the Royal Chapel were constructed. Later additions included the Opera and the Petit Trianon (a small chateau), which was built between the years 1761 - 1764 for Louis XV and Madame de Pompadour.<br><br>
			During the French Revolution, the incredible collection of paintings, antiques, and other works of art that had been amassed at Versailles were transferred to the Louvre and other important items went to the National Library and Conservatory of Arts and Crafts. Most of the furniture, historians say, was sold at auction.<br><br>
			After the Revolution, Napoleon spent his summers at Versailles until he abdicated. Later, it was Louis-Phillipe who, in 1830, transformed the chateau into a grand museum, dedicated to "the glory of France." The Chapel, the Opera, and the Hall of Mirrors were preserved but many smaller apartments were destroyed to make room for spacious exhibition halls. In the 1960s, however, curator Pierre Verlet was responsible for getting some of the furnishings back and restoring a number of the royal apartments.<br><br> Today, visitors to Versailles can visit much of the interior of this spectacular palace, as well as its world-famous garden.<br><br>Discover more history about Versailles through the ages from <a href="http://www.aviewoncities.com/paris/versailles.htm" class="webCite">A View On Cities</a></p></blockquote>
